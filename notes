-- Topic vs Queue
	when a message is recieved by a TOPIC the message will be sent the first consumer that gets it, then if we have another message it will be receieved by the next consumer (ONE-TO-MANY) and so on (a tour de role)
	
	when a message is recieved by a QUEUE it's consumed only by one consumer (ONE-TO-ONE)
	
	
-- JMS vs Kafka
	Kafka have better performance
	JMS & RabbitMQ don't have a mechanism to control the speed of receieved messages (PUSH MODEL)
	Kafka came with a protocol that controls the speed of receieved messages (PULL MODEL)
	Kafka++: allows us to store flow of records durable & fault tolerant + Real Time Stream Processing (Analytics)
	Kafka doesn't have Queue & Topic, it have only Topic which is more general, it means that we can build a Queue with it (Consumers Groups)
	
	Scenario: collect a lot of data with Kafka then batch process it at some point in time.
